# Color Block Picker
This game is designed to make you feel bad about yourself if you are colorblind.  The rules are quite simple.

- On load, you will be given 12 colored blocks to choose from.
- The 'pick this color' tells you which color you should try to pick.
- Too many blocks? Adjust the number anywhere between 1 and 12. 
- The answer to "Do you know your colors?" will display after each selection.
- If you get it right, you win! Yay! Start a new game to mix things up.
